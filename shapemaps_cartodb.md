# Creating shape maps in CartoDB

## Find both sets of data: values, and shapes

First you need to find the data you want to map. Normally you will need to merge **two** datasets:

1. Firstly, the values you want to show on the map (these might be numerical, such as crime rates or votes, or categorical, such as food ratings or political party)
2. Secondly, the *shapes* you want to put on the map (colouring them comes later)
